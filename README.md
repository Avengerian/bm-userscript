## About This Repository
This is simple userscript that takes advantage of custom triggers you may have created in BM, as well as parse important text. I made this help color code important details like Squad Leaders, among other things. Having 100 users on a table with varying info can make parsing rather hard, this makes it easy.
Note this code is intended for the BattleMetrics RCON product, used by server admins. Not to be confused with the standard BattleMetrics server list. 
## What Is TamperMonkey
It’s a browser addon that loads “userscripts” that can modify how a website display’s itself to you. User scripts are powerful tools that can totally modify websites. Remember, tampermonkey can pose significant security issues for your device if you install scripts from unknown sources. Only use scripts if you know what they are doing!
