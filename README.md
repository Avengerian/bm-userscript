## About This Repository
This is simple userscript that takes advantage of custom triggers you may have created in BM, as well as parse important text. I made this help color code important details like Squad Leaders, among other things. Having 100 users on a table with varying info can make parsing rather hard, this makes it easy.
Note this code is intended for the BattleMetrics RCON product, used by server admins. Not to be confused with the standard BattleMetrics server list. 

## Features Of This Userscript
* Highly customizable!
* Grays out unimportant events like joins/leaves (customizable)
* Adds full width colored bars for teamkills (w/ help from a BM trigger tag)
* Adds a clickable link for SteamID that goes to the communitybanlist.com/<theSteamid>
* Highlights users with clan tags (if BM decides to displays it)
* Highlights Squad Leaders in RCON side panel.
* Highlights BM Admins in RCON player side panel.
* Highlights Admins in activity side panel.
* Highlights Sorry For TK (optional userscript).
* Highlights moderation events in red.

## What Is TamperMonkey
It’s a browser addon that loads “userscripts” that can modify how a website display’s itself to you. User scripts are powerful tools that can totally modify websites. Remember, tampermonkey can pose significant security issues for your device if you install scripts from unknown sources. Only use scripts if you know what they are doing!
## Installing TamperMonkey
https://www.tampermonkey.net/ (I recommend Stable)
## Triggers I Use
You click the URL, then scroll down to the bottom and create trigger. Do not modify them.

Note: These only apply to the game Squad, and may not work at all in other games.

## Add The Script
* Once you downloaded the extension to your browser, locate it at the upper right of your browser and right click it. 
* Create a new script, this will open new tab. Replace EVERYTHING within it with the userscript.js found here, then press CTRL+S.
* Go the BM website and it should show as a red +1 next to TamperMonkey icon, if the script is working. 
* If you see no +1 in Red, you may need to toggle the script on, head back to the browser icon for TamperMonkey and check that your script is enabled.
